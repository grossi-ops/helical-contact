This repository hosts Chapter 10 of Volume IV of *Principia Orthogona* — *Helical Attractors on Contact 3-Manifolds* — together with the three-session **XII Bienal da SBM 2026** mini-curso delivered at UFRN (Natal-RN) and the submission artefacts Pablo Nogueira Grossi files to the Bienal in four categories. Every page is a standalone teaching artefact: the three sessions can be read in sequence as a 180-minute course, the 3D simulator runs in the browser with no install, and the DOP853 numerical lab reproduces the tables from the chapter.

## Where Chapter 10 sits in the series

*Principia Orthogona* is a five-volume series on **Generative Temporal Contact Theory (GTCT)**:

| G | Volume | Substrate | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G¹ | Vol I · GOMC | Abstract operator algebra | The orthogonal operator |
| G² | Vol II · TOGT | Contact geometry on 3-manifolds | Contact fixed point, g₃₃ = 33 |
| G³ | Vol III · Mini Beast | Biological instantiations | Living form |
| G⁴ | **Vol IV · GTCT-T1 (IMPA Edition) — this volume** | **Temporal contact** | **Helical attractors on the dm³ basin** |
| G⁵ | Vol V · AXLE | Formal verification in Lean 4 | Complete Completeness |

**Chapter 10 of Vol IV** is the self-contained exposition of the *dm³ operator* — a toy-model realisation of the full GTCT operator chain `G = U ∘ F ∘ K ∘ C` on the standard contact 3-manifold `(ℝ³, α)` with `α = dz − r² dθ` (polar coordinates). The helical attractors in the title are the orbits `Γ = {r = 1}` of the induced Reeb-like flow; the asymmetric basin described in Theorem 2.1 is the geometric object the entire course is organised around.

## The mini-curso — what each piece contains

Three 60-minute sessions, one embedded 3D simulator, one numerical lab, and a short primer chapter used as warm-up reading.

### Warm-up · [`chE-gtct.html`](./chE-gtct.html) — *GTCT for Everyone*

A standalone primer, originally written for Book 3 (*Mini-Beast*) and reused here. It answers "what is an axiom?" then states the **nine axioms of GTCT**, walks through the **twelve operators** as a map of the generative cycle (with an embedded *GTCT Time Machine — G Orbit Simulator*), states the **four main theorems**, reframes time through **five properties** (Order, Novelty, Rhythm, Irreversibility, Emergence), and closes with the **Seed Theorem** and a Prompt Panel. Participants read it before Session 1 and use it between sessions as a one-page reference card. This page is also the canonical home of the repo's *Principia Orthogona* dark-teal design language — every other page inherits from it.

### Session 1 · [`sessions/session1-contact-geometry.html`](./sessions/session1-contact-geometry.html) — *Contact Geometry and the dm³ System*

The first session builds the geometric stage. Outline:

1. **What is a contact 3-manifold?** The pair `(M, α)` with `dα|_{ker α}` non-degenerate.
2. **The prototype — ℝ³ with α = dz − r² dθ.** The polar Darboux model the whole chapter is written on.
3. **The Reeb vector field** and its flow on the prototype.
4. **The dm³ system.** The full three-equation ODE is exhibited and dissected:
   - *Anatomy of the radial equation* `ṙ = r(1 − r²) + ε(r − 1) e^(−z)` — logistic term plus coupling.
   - *Anatomy of the vertical equation* `ż = r² − ε(r − 1)² e^(−z)` — gain minus decay.
   - *Why ε matters* — the coupling strength that makes the basin asymmetric (fixed at ε = 2 throughout Vol IV).
5. **Live simulator** — the embedded `helical-attractor.html` runs inside the page with a guided 15-minute experiment block.
6. **Hand-off to Session S2.**

### Session 2 · [`sessions/session2-theorem-basin.html`](./sessions/session2-theorem-basin.html) — *Theorem 2.1 and the Asymmetric Basin*

The mathematical core of the mini-curso.

1. **Theorem 2.1 — Exponential Contraction to Γ.** For the dm³ system with ε = 2, if `|r(0) − 1| < 1/3` and `z(0) ≥ log 2`, then `r(t) → 1` exponentially with rate `μ = −2`; otherwise the orbit may escape and the basin is asymmetric.
2. **Linearisation at r = 1.** Where the `−2` comes from in one line — the derivative of the logistic term evaluated on Γ.
3. **The Grönwall sketch** (three steps):
   - Step 1 — the scalar inequality `d/dt |r − 1|² ≤ … `.
   - Step 2 — bound the bad pieces (the coupling term and the `e^(−z)` factor).
   - Step 3 — solve for `ε₀`, the allowed displacement.
4. **Table 1** — the numerical check at DOP853 precision (rtol = 10⁻¹⁰, atol = 10⁻¹²), with a `Read the table` segment and a "What goes wrong geometrically" explanation of inner-basin failure.
5. **Live numerical demo** — the embedded simulator is used to watch the inner edge of the basin in real time (8-minute guided demo).
6. **Hand-off to Session S3.**

### Session 3 · [`sessions/session3-lean-skeleton.html`](./sessions/session3-lean-skeleton.html) — *Lean 4 Skeleton and AXLE Issue #12*

Session 3 migrates the Session 2 proof into Lean 4 and leaves the participant holding a specific open conjecture.

1. **Why Lean 4, why now** — the formalisation case for contact dynamical systems.
2. **`AXLE/Chain.lean` — the operator chain.** Reading the Lean structure for `G = U ∘ F ∘ K ∘ C`.
3. **`SpiralReturn` — formalising Theorem 2.1.** What is already proved (the exponential-contraction *conclusion* and the linearisation *base case*) versus what is still `sorry` (the inductive step).
4. **AXLE Issue #12 — the Lipschitz estimate.** The specific `sorry` the participant leaves the session tracking; two already-closed issues are shown as precedent for how such estimates have been discharged before in AXLE.
5. **How to contribute.** A short list of Mathlib files to read before opening a PR, and a reference sim for grounding the proof in the flow it describes.
6. **What the course did.**

### Interactive simulator · [`sims/helical-attractor.html`](./sims/helical-attractor.html)

A standalone Three.js (r128) visualisation of the dm³ flow on `(ℝ³, α)`. Orbits are integrated in the browser; the helical attractor `Γ = {r = 1}` is rendered as a persistent reference curve; drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, drop initial points to watch them fall into the outer basin (contraction to Γ) or the inner basin (collapse). Embedded inside Sessions 1 and 2 as well; also reachable from the landing page's 3D hero.

### Numerical lab · [`labs/dm3_numeric.py`](./labs/dm3_numeric.py)

A single-file SciPy script that integrates the dm³ ODE with `solve_ivp(method='DOP853')` at rtol = 10⁻¹⁰ / atol = 10⁻¹², fits the empirical contraction rate `μ̂` as the slope of `log|r(t) − 1|` on `t ∈ [5, 20]`, records the early-time `ż` diagnostic, and prints the canonical Table 1.

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
python3 labs/dm3_numeric.py            # prints Table 1 to stdout
python3 labs/dm3_numeric.py --plot     # also saves dm3_trajectories.png (requires matplotlib)
```

Expected output: outer-basin rows converging to `μ̂ = −2`, inner-basin rows showing solver collapse when the integration falls off the asymmetric edge.

## AXLE — formal-verification companion

The Lean 4 engine that proves the dm³ operator's structural invariants lives in a sibling repository:

- **AXLE** (Lean 4 + Mathlib4): <https://github.com/TOTOGT/AXLE> — contains `Chain.lean` and `SpiralReturn.lean` referenced in Session 3.
- **Issue #12** — the open Lipschitz estimate: <https://github.com/TOTOGT/AXLE/issues/12>

Companion theory repository — **GTCT** (working notes and drafts): <https://github.com/TOTOGT/GTCT>.

## XII Bienal da SBM 2026 — submission artefacts

The same Chapter 10 material is submitted in four SBM categories. Files live in [`submissions/`](./submissions/). The SBM *Eixo Temático* mapping used here:

| Eixo | Theme |
| --- | --- |
| T1  | Belos Problemas e Belas Soluções |
| T2  | História da Matemática |
| T10 | Geometria e Topologia |

| Artefact | Category | Eixo |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `submissions/XII_BM_MINICURSO_T1_Pablo_Grossi_preview.pdf` | Minicurso (preview) | T1 |
| `submissions/PO_10_Pablo_Grossi.{tex,pdf,…}` | Pôster | T10 (Geometria e Topologia) |
| `submissions/PO_10_Pablo_Grossi_source.pdf` | Pôster typesetting source reference | — |
| `submissions/PO_10_T2_Pablo_Grossi.{tex,pdf,…}` | Pôster (second eixo) | T2 |
| `submissions/CO_T2_Pablo_Grossi.{tex,pdf,…}` | Comunicação Oral | T2 |
| `submissions/OF_T2_Pablo_Grossi.{tex,pdf,…}` | Oficina | T2 |

**SBM filename convention:** `{PREFIX}_T{N}_{FirstName}_{LastSurname}.pdf` where `PREFIX ∈ {MC, OF, PO, CO, Ex}` and `{N}` is the Eixo number — the `PO_10` / `MINICURSO` filenames will need the `T` prefix inserted before upload (e.g., `PO_T10_Pablo_Grossi.pdf`, `MC_T1_Pablo_Grossi.pdf`).
